                    <p>About project:</p> 
                    <p>My latest completed project is a small demo using the game engine RPG Maker XP + Pokémon Essentials Plugin
                        Essentials is plugin that allows the resources from old Pokémon games to be used in the development of new games and it supports your own scripting/programming/modifications to the source code. 
                        I made a small playable demo that uses some of the well-known features of the engine to . The engine is ancient and the plugin is not very well documented
                        so the challenge was learning how to use those systems to implement certain features. The demo has cutscenes, dialogue options 
                        and predefined NPC movement for the cutscenes.</p>
                    <p>Tech used: ruby programming language, visual studio code, rpg maker xp, pokemon essentials</p>
                    <p>Features: custom characters, branching dialogue system, map events, custom scripts</p>

                    <p>About project:</p> 
                    <p>Application developed in collaboration with 5 other students for a software engineering course at the University of California San Diego. 
                        The process was based on the Agile methodology and included a planning phase, design, development and testing. The team had stand up meetings at the beginning or ending of a class
                        and also met once or twice a week for pair programming and other tasks. Planning phase including reading the requirements, activities like
                        planning poker, creating user stories, test cases and tasks divided by phases. My tasks included testing and development.
                    </p>
                    <p>Description: Allows users to input the coordinates of places and share their locations with other users so that the
                    locations are displayed on a user interface that resembles a compass (circular view). The location updates in real time and users can set custom
                    labels on the interface.
